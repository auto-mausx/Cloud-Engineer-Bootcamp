# Memory Monitoring

[Home](/README.md)

Learn this:

* List the primary (inter-related) considerations and tasks involved in memory tuning.

* Use entries in `/proc/sys/vm`, and decipher `/proc/meminfo`.

* Use ``vmstat`` to display information about memory, paging, I/O, processor activity, and processes' memory consumption.

* Understand how the OOM-killer decides when to take action and selects which processes should be exterminated to open up some memory.

## Memory Monitoring tweaks

When tweaking parameters in `/proc/sys/vm`, the usual best practice is to adjust one thing at a time and look for effects. The primary (inter-related) tasks are:

* Controlling flushing parameters; i.e., how many pages are allowed to be dirty and how often they are flushed out to disk.

* Controlling swap behavior; i.e., how much pages that reflect file contents are allowed to remain in memory, as opposed to those that need to be swapped out as they have no other backing store.

* Controlling how much memory overcommission is allowed, since many programs never need the full amount of memory they request, particularly because of copy on write (COW) techniques.

### Table for memory tools

## /proc/meminfo

* remember that /proc/ is a pseudo file system

* /proc/meminfo/ has a TON of info

## /proc/sys/vm

Here is where you can tune the Virtual Memory systems

* you can make changes by writing to the entry

* or by `sysctl`

* or by modifying `/etc/sysctl.conf` values at boot time

## vmstat

* see [vmstat man page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/vmstat)

`vmstat` is a multi-purpose tool that displays information about memory, paging, I/O, processor activity and processes. It has many options. The general form of the command is:

`vmstat [options] [delay] [count]`

If delay is given in seconds, the report is repeated at that interval count times; if count is not given, `vmstat` will keep reporting statistics forever, until it is killed by a signal, such as Ctrl-C.

If no other arguments are given, you can see what vmstat displays, where the first line shows averages since the last reboot, while succeeding lines show activity during the specified interval.

## OOM Killer

the kernel permits overcommission of memory, but only for pages dedicated to user processes; pages used within the kernel are not swappable and are always allocated at request time.

You can modify, and even turn off this overcommission b
y setting the value of `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`:

0. (default) Permit overcommission, but refuse obvious overcommits, and give root users somewhat more memory allocation than normal users.

1. All memory requests are allowed to overcommit.

2. Turn off overcommission. Memory requests will fail when the total memory commit reaches the size of the swap space plus a configurable percentage (50 by default) of RAM. This factor is modified changing `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio`.

If available memory is exhausted, Linux invokes the OOM-killer (Out Of Memory) to decide which process(es) should be exterminated to open up some memory.

There is no precise science for this; the algorithm must be heuristic and cannot satisfy everyone. In the minds of many developers, the purpose of the OOM-killer is to permit a graceful shutdown, rather than be a part of normal operations.
