# Memory Monitoring

[Home](/README.md)

Learn this:

* List the primary (inter-related) considerations and tasks involved in memory tuning.

* Use entries in `/proc/sys/vm`, and decipher `/proc/meminfo`.

* Use ``vmstat`` to display information about memory, paging, I/O, processor activity, and processes' memory consumption.

* Understand how the OOM-killer decides when to take action and selects which processes should be exterminated to open up some memory.

## Memory Monitoring tweaks

When tweaking parameters in `/proc/sys/vm`, the usual best practice is to adjust one thing at a time and look for effects. The primary (inter-related) tasks are:

* Controlling flushing parameters; i.e., how many pages are allowed to be dirty and how often they are flushed out to disk.
  
  *(Pages in the main memory that have been modified during writing data to disk are marked as "dirty" and have to be flushed to disk before they can be freed. When a file write occurs, the cached page for the particular block is looked up.)*

* Controlling swap behavior; i.e., how much pages that reflect file contents are allowed to remain in memory, as opposed to those that need to be swapped out as they have no other backing store.

* Controlling how much memory overcommission is allowed, since many programs never need the full amount of memory they request, particularly because of copy on write (COW) techniques.

## /proc/sys/vm

Here is where you can tune the Virtual Memory systems

* you can make changes by writing to the entry

* or by `sysctl`

* or by modifying `/etc/sysctl.conf` values at boot time

### Table: /proc/sys/vm Entries
| ENTRY  |  MEANING |
| ------- | ------- |
| admin_reserve_kbytes  |  Amount of free memory reserved for privileged users |
| block_dump | Enables block I/O debugging |

| legacy_va_layout | Use old layout (2.4 kernel) for how memory mappings are displayed |

## vmstat

* see [vmstat man page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/vmstat)

`vmstat` is a multi-purpose tool that displays information about memory, paging, I/O, processor activity and processes. It has many options. The general form of the command is:

`vmstat [options] [delay] [count]`

If delay is given in seconds, the report is repeated at that interval count times; if count is not given, `vmstat` will keep reporting statistics forever, until it is killed by a signal, such as Ctrl-C.

If no other arguments are given, you can see what vmstat displays, where the first line shows averages since the last reboot, while succeeding lines show activity during the specified interval.

## OOM Killer

the kernel permits overcommission of memory, but only for pages dedicated to user processes; pages used within the kernel are not swappable and are always allocated at request time.

You can modify, and even turn off this overcommission by setting the value of `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`:

0. (default) Permit overcommission, but refuse obvious overcommits, and give root users somewhat more memory allocation than normal users.

1. All memory requests are allowed to overcommit.

2. Turn off overcommission. Memory requests will fail when the total memory commit reaches the size of the swap space plus a configurable percentage (50 by default) of RAM. This factor is modified changing `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio`.

If available memory is exhausted, Linux invokes the OOM-killer (Out Of Memory) to decide which process(es) should be exterminated to open up some memory.

There is no precise science for this; the algorithm must be heuristic and cannot satisfy everyone. In the minds of many developers, the purpose of the OOM-killer is to permit a graceful shutdown, rather than be a part of normal operations.

### Real World Example of OOM:

*"An aircraft company discovered that it was cheaper to fly its planes with less fuel on board. The planes would be lighter and use less fuel and money was saved. On rare occasions however the amount of fuel was insufficient, and the plane would crash. This problem was solved by the engineers of the company by the development of a special OOF (out-of-fuel) mechanism. In emergency cases a passenger was selected and thrown out of the plane. (When necessary, the procedure was repeated.) A large body of theory was developed and many publications were devoted to the problem of properly selecting the victim to be ejected. Should the victim be chosen at random? Or should one choose the heaviest person? Or the oldest? Should passengers pay in order not to be ejected, so that the victim would be the poorest on board? And if for example the heaviest person was chosen, should there be a special exception in case that was the pilot? Should first class passengers be exempted? Now that the OOF mechanism existed, it would be activated every now and then, and eject passengers even when there was no fuel shortage. The engineers are still studying precisely how this malfunction is caused."*

In order to make decisions of who gets sacrificed to keep the system alive, a value called the badness is computed (which can be read from /proc/[pid]/oom_score) for each process on the system and the order of the killing is determined by this value.

Two entries in the same directory can be used to promote or demote the likelihood of extermination. The value of oom_adj is the number of bits the points should be adjusted by. Normal users can only increase the badness; a decrease (a negative value for oom_adj) can only be specified by a superuser. The value of oom_adj_score directly adjusts the point value. Note that the use of oom_adj is deprecated.

## Lab 13.1. Invoking the OOM-Killer

Examine what swap partitions and files are present on your system by examining ```/proc/swaps```.

Turn off all swap with the command

```$ sudo /sbin/swapoff -a```

Make sure you turn it back on later, when we are done, with

```$ sudo /sbin/swapon -a```

Now we are going to put the system under increasing memory pressure. One way to do this is to exploit the ```stress-ng``` programwe installed earlier, running it with arguments such as:

```$ stress-ng -m 12 -t 10s``` 

which would keep 3 GB busy for 10 seconds.

You should see the **OOM**(Out of Memory) killer swoop in and try to kill processes in a struggle to stay alive. You can see whatis going on by running **dmesg** or monitoring ```/var/log/ messages``` or ```/var/log/syslog```, or through graphical interfaces thatexpose the system logs. 


Who gets clobbered first?


## Check on Learning


### 13.1:
Disabling all swap partitions increases the chances of the system invoking the OOM-killer. True or False?

* True

### 13.2:
Memory used for file caching has more priority than memory used by system processes. The OOM-killer is invoked if there is insufficient memory for both file caching and the user process. True or False?

* False

### 13.3:
What is moved to the swap area is never moved back to the main memory. True or False?

* False

### 13.4:
The field MemFree entry in /proc/meminfo shows the amount of memory that is not utilized, but the file caching could also be considered free memory as the kernel would release memory used by the cache if applications need more memory. True or False?

* True
